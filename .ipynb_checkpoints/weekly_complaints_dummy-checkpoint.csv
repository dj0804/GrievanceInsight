"The mess food is awful, it's uncooked and smells bad. Please check the quality control."
My hostel room fan is not working. I submitted a request last week but no one came. Urgent!
I need my grade verified for the Algorithms course. I think there was a clerical error.
Staff at the administration office were rude and unhelpful when I asked about my fees.
There's a massive water leak near Block C of the boys' hostel. It needs immediate repair.
The quality of the chicken in the mess today was terrible. Tasted stale.
I can't access the online portal for my subject registration. It keeps showing an error.
Another complaint about the poor ventilation in the library study room. It's too hot.
